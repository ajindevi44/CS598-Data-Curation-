# CS598-Data-Curation-
Assignment 3: Ontologies / ER Diagram Design Exercise
Learning objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:

Become familiar with ER diagrams and strategies for data integration.
Gain experience analyzing the characteristics of data and integrating data sources.
Remember, this exercise is not about learning ER diagrams. This is an opportunity to reflect on the data modeling and integration and how it solves data management problems.

Scenario
You are back at the auto dealer from Assignment 1. They have merged with a dealer of pre-owned cars, and they need to integrate their data. See the attached document, which describes the database used by the pre-owned dealer.

You will be asked to create ER diagrams for this assignment. Your diagram should include entities, attributes, relationships, and keys. Please label the primary and foreign keys, as this is not a standard convention for ER diagrams. If you are not using a common notation style (e.g., Chen, UML-crow’s feet), please include a legend to assist the instructors in grading. The slides in Week 5, Video 4 contain examples of ER diagrams that would work for this assignment.

Instructions
Create an ER diagram for Pre-owned dealer database, as described in the attached file.
Create a separate ER diagram that reflects the schema you designed for Assignment 1. You may update the schema based on feedback you received from instructors after submitting Assignment 1.
Create 1 to 3 intermediate ER diagrams that showcase your integration process. These diagrams should be accompanied by narrative prose (either in a separate document or as annotations directly to the diagram) that describe each of the integration steps taken on the diagram. See the integration process described in the data integration slides for examples of what this might look like, and follow the example shown in the “Schema integration: an example” lecture. There is no one right way to do this, but your decisions should be justifiable, and should minimize the potential for information loss.
Finally, create one integrated ER diagram represented the merged schemas of the two dealerships (i.e., the final product of the integration process). Be sure to describe any final integration steps taken at this point (as described in step 3 above).
Submit your documents to Assignment 3 Peer Review for peer grading. Each student will be required to grade the submissions of 5 of their peers. Submissions will be graded based on the following criteria. Write a constructive and professional review and post to the course forum replying to the individual’s submission.
Is everything represented?
Is it clearly written? Are the ER diagrams and integration process presented?
What are the pros and cons of the representation in the integrated ER diagram?
What are the pros and cons of this integration process?
How could it be done differently? How could it be improved?
6. Using your peer reviews, revise and submit all documents to Assignment 3 Submission for instructor grading.

If you have questions about the assignment, use the course Forum. This is a great place to ask questions and also help your fellow classmates.
